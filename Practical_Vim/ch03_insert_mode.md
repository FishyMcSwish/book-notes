# Insert Mode

## Tips

- Use delete commands from insert mode without leaving Insert mode.  When you screw up a word, delete the whole word and retype it.  You will improve as a typist and it will become faster.
- Switch back to Normal mode frequently.  Switching to Insert Normal mode lets you fire one Normal Mode command without leaving Insert mode, with `<C-o>`
- Paste from a register without leaving Insert mode with `<C-r>`{register}
- Put stuff in the expresion register with <C-r>`=.  E.g., you can do math!  Try <C-r>`={6+5}`<CR>`
- Insert characters by unicode hex code with `<C-v>u{4 digit code} from insert mode, e.g. à­©
- Or <C-v>'U{up to 8 digits} to get a longer hex code that includes emoji.  ðŸ¤£
- You can do digraphs from Insert mode with <C-k>'{char1}{char2}.  See :h digraphs-default, or :digraphs, :digraphs-table.  Â©
